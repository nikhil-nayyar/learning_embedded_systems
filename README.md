# Learning Embedded Systems Software

This repository hosts the weekly module assignments associated with CU Boulder's pair of embedded systems courses. The structure of the files was created for the scope by the course instructor Alex Fosdick but any and all code solutions/implementations was developed by Nikhil Nayyar. Files with code implementations by Nikhil Nayyar will include comments indicating such at the head of the file.
