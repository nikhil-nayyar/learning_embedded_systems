Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environment

##Purpose
This repository contains the code for UC Boulder's introductory embedded systems course. The repo is divided into the various module assignments that allow me to implement the material I am learning from the course.

## Breakdown
### Module 1
The first module serves as a (re)introduction to C. The goal was to implement some basic C statistical functions in the stats.h and stats.c files.
### Module 2
The second module serves as a crash course in building files. The goal was to implement a Makefile that enabled cross platform compiliation via a flag set in the command line call to make. Thus, it involved extensive use of Make variables and conditionals in addition to the implementation of calls to gcc with the proper flags. All development by me was completed in the files sources.mk and Makefile.
### Module 3
The third module revolved around the analysis of Memory usage in a given C file. No code was explicitly written for this module but various utilities and analysis files were used. The analysis was conducted primarily with the following: - nm binary utility
- readelf
- gcc generation of .map files
